# Rack enclosure

The rack enclosure has two parts: the riser and the frame for the rack ears. The design assumes the use of 22x33mm lumber. They come in 2400mm and 3000mm lengths where I live.

## BOM for two rack enclosures

This BOM assumes that the pieces are cut from a 2400mm long piece. 5mm extra is added to the length of each item when trying to divide up lumber between them to account for the width of the saw blade and the occasional mistake.

| Length    | Count | Remarks                                                            |
| --------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |

| 326mm     | 4     | 90 degree ends                                                     |

| 355.6mm   | 4     | 10 degree across the long side on one end                          |
| 441.245mm | 4     | 38.68 degree acros the long side on one end and 41.32 on the other |
| 526.6mm   | 8     | 90 degree ends                                                     |

5. Cut 3 pieces from lumber #1
6. Cut 1 piece from lumber #2
7. Adjust the stopper to 441.245mm
8. Cut 4 pieces from lumber #2
9. Adjust the stopper to 355.6mm
10. Cut 4 pieces from lumber #3

18. Cut 3 pieces from lumber #5

### Cutting the angled pieces 

1. Adjust the cutting angle to 10 degress off and adjust the stopper for the 355.6mm piece
2. Turn the piece so that the angled end goes across the long side
3. Cut the 355.6mm pieces
4. Adjust the cutting angle to 38,68 off and adjust the stopper for the 441.245mm piece
5. Turn the piece so that the angled end goes across the long side
6. Cut the 441.245mm pieces
7. Adjust the angle to 41.32 degrees without changing the stopper
8. Cut the other end of the 441.245mm pieces, when done, the piece should form a trapezoid
